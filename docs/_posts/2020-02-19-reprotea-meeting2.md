**When**: 19 February 2020 from 15:00 to 16:00

**Where**: Room A229 at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (Wundtlaan 1, 6525 XD Nijmegen)

**What**: The second meeting of ReproducibiliTea Nijmegen!
[ReproducibiliTea](https://reproducibilitea.org/) is a grassroots journal club initiative.
As suggested by the name, the discussions in these journal clubs revolves around matters of open science and reproducibility.

In this meeting, we'll be discussing "Fallibility in science: Responding to the work of oneself and others by Dorothy Bishop (2018).
You can read the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918776632).
In this meeting we'll discuss the inevitability of making mistakes when conducting research and what to do when we ourselves have made a mistake or when we find someone else's mistakes.

Eirini would also quite like to discuss initiatives like [the loss of confidence project](https://lossofconfidence.com/) and Rebecca Willen's "radical honesty" about how transparently results were reported in her papers [(see here)](https://rmwillen.info/publications/).
Do you know of more initiatives like this? Let us know :blush:

Other ReproducibiliTea journal clubs are partnering up with [repliCATS](https://replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/) this February to assess the replicability of scientific claims.
Eirini attended a preSIPS repliCATS workshop this summer and she loved it!
If there's interest, we can organise a second ReproducibiliTea in February :heart_eyes_cat:
