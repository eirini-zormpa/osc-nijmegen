ReproducibiliTea is a global initiative bringing journal clubs on reproducibility and open science to, at the time of writing, about 20 countries spread over 4 continents. There is more information on the initiative and current chapter on the [ReproducibiliTea website](https://reproducibilitea.org/).

## Objectives
- learn about cool papers/initiatives related to open open science and reproducibility
- have friendly and engaging discussions about open science and reproducibility
- meet new people interested in these topics in the Radboud campus
- :tea: :tea: :tea:

## Paper suggestions
We want this journal club to reflect the interests of its members--you!
You can add your suggestions and contact information [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1efHsgzEu9OqKNRk9EARDNL3gBfsPNRgbdt7-PhfWS-U/edit?usp=sharing).
Suggestions can be peer-reviewed papers, but also preprints, blog posts, iniatives etc.

When you suggest papers for discussion please keep these guidelines in mind:
- the topic of the paper should be relevant for open science (e.g.  pre-registration, replicability, reproducibility, robustness, open access, transparency, inclusivity, diversity, philosophy of science)
- length should not exceed 12 pages (for journal-formatted papers; 24 for double-spaced ones)
- not too technical please--discussion should be accessible to be people of different backgrounds!

## Practical info
The journal club will meet monthly (see dates below) at **15:00** at the **Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (room A229)**. The person who suggested the topic of discussion will introduce it in 10 minutes or under and then we discuss! Meetings will last no longer than an hour.

In the presentation of the paper/topic of discussion identify:
- the *problem* the paper addresses
- the *solution* the paper advocates
- the *relevance* of the paper (for the presenter or more generally)
- what is *special* about the paper
- the *limitations* of the paper
